# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will complete the story for the visual novel, have all 5 paths done and all 3 endings finished. I also will draw all the character models.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I can draw all the backgrounds and all the cinematic drawings.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to be able to make the script the best it can be, so it all makes sense and flows nicely.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The first thing I need to do for my final project is write the script. Once I write the script, I can translate
the code right into the program I'm using, Renpy. After I finish coding all the paths and endings, I'll draw the
character models, backgrounds, and cinematic pictures. For this project I'll need to learn Renpy through their 
documentation page. I'll also research detective behavior/law for the premise of the story.
